Horiseon Website Refactoring

This website is for a service that is dedicated in making companies more online search engine friendly. This would allow potential visitors to find the company and what they are about more easily, and it would allow the company to broadcast their site more effectively.

This site is only the landing page, but it can serve as a template for later additions.

Below is a screenshot of the page:
